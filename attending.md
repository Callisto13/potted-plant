An Inception gets people aligned on what needs to be done by providing a forum
for people to ask questions and root out misguided assumptions.

## What is the Goal of an Inception?

**TLDR:**
- Helps teams get aligned on the what problem needs to be solved
- Focuses the team on what to build and where to start
- Helps team deliver value quickly and not waste time building the wrong thing
- Helps product team validate their models and ensure they are asking for the right thing

The desired outcome of an Inception is for the various stakeholders to achieve alignment
on the proposed piece of work.

Stakeholders include:
- Clients
  - These can be internal (another team consuming the api) or external
- Product people
- Sales people
- Marketing people
- The engineers who will be working on it
- Support teams
- Other upstream or downstream team representatives

If an Inception is successful then engineers should feel confident and empowered
to immediately start working on the solution. If this is not the vibe, then something has gone wrong
at some point in the process.

This is usually the final stage before a piece of work goes into development.
Inceptions can also be run to realign around an existing project which has been going on for a while.

They are also a great chance for engineers to ask all the questions, get exited about
and really take ownership of a project/product.

An Inception is a **team sport**, and every attendee is encouraged to play their part
at every stage.

Sometimes an Inception results in the healthy early discovery that stakeholders and
goals for the project are unclear and additional work needs to be done to refine and
agree on the shared goals before the team can start working. Achieving clarity and
alignment on issues before the team starts is far better than learning this after a
team has been working for weeks or longer on work that is later thrown away. [_citation_](https://www.infoq.com/articles/project-inception-meeting/).

## What do I do in an Inception?

If you have been invited to an Inception, the first thing you need to do is understand why:
what role will you be expected to play. Again, there is no coasting and you are there for a
reason.

General requirements for all attendees are explained in the rest of this doc, but here are some
specific roles:

- Product manager or owner: you will naturally be required to know the Product inside and out.
  Including things like goals/non-goals, end users, high level flows, etc. You will need to
	provide answers around the entire problem space. You will also need to be flexible enough that,
	when assumptions are challenged or decisions found incorrect, you are able to shift the outline.
- Subject matter expert SME: you have been invited to explain certain pieces (likely technical)
  in a proposed solution. Be ready to answer questions in depth.


## What needs to happen before an Inception?

Quite a lot. Nearly all the Product discovery and decision-making should play out
_before_ even scheduling an Inception. Organisers should aim to get people in the room
with as little uncertainty as possible.

The main responsibility of attendees in the pre-Inception phase is to ensure they are
as informed as possible. This means reading all provided material (product and technical docs).
If you have been invited to an Inception and you have not been given anything/enough to read,
or indeed enough time to read it in, then this is a problem.

Inceptions only work if everyone is sufficiently informed to have an intelligent and in-depth
conversation about the problem space. This doesn't mean you have to understand everything perfectly
(Juniors, especially: go easy on yourself), but that you have enough questions so that you are
able to gain some understanding. I don't mean "save up your questions until the day", of course;
ask all the questions as you go through the docs and do whatever you need to do to make yourself
as informed as possible.

_Another note to Juniors, for Inceptions and work in general I guess: keep asking those
questions. If you are not "getting it", then it is not being explained properly to you. Demand better._

Everyone should aim to go into an Inception knowing at least these key things:
- What they are building at a high level?
- Why they are building it? (aka What is the problem?)
- Who they are building it for? (who will use it)
- A high-level vague idea of one or two solutions

Each person may have a different picture in their head or answer to those things, but
the Inception will hammer those out.

Again: you don't need to know all the things (there will be SMEs there for that purpose) but aim
to know enough to ask good questions and participate fully. Your input, thoughts and ideas matter,
or you wouldn't be on the guest list :smile:.

## What happens during an Inception?

This Inception format is broken down into the following activities:

- Motivation
  - Outcome: everyone can explain clearly and confidently what this work will achieve
- Goals, Non-Goals
  - Outcome: clarity on what is in/out of scope for this stretch. expectations are set
- Risks and Mitigations
  - Outcome: understanding of what could stop us achieving our goals. know how to counter these obstacles.
- Actors/Personas/Users
  - Outcome: gain empathy with are target consumers, ensure all contracts are covered
- Activities/User Flows
  - Outcome: high level flows for each persona established
- Story mapping
  - Outcome: bunch of stories in the backlog, ready for pointing
- Closing tasks (risks revisited, parking lot)
- Retro
  - Outcome: feedback on retro format, venting on stuff etc
- Pointing party (or just regular planning)
  - Outcome: work can begin

_See the [facilitation notes](facilitating.md) for a more detailed breakdown of these sections._

The most important rule when attending an Inception is focus. In IRL Inceptions phones are
locked away, laptops are banned, etc. This is harder to enforce online, so we rely on self-discipline
and respect. This means you are responsible for quitting Slack and staying off it.
This means no parallel work.

If you are a stakeholder who cannot

a) attend this meeting

b) pay attention during this meeting

and yet you still expect to heavily control or influence the project's decisions, you signal
to the team that they cannot rely on your support or attention in the future.

Also not paying attention is just rude. Try not to waste everyone else's time by zoning out.

## What happens after an Inception?

You do the work.

If you can't do the work, then something went wrong. Likely one of:
- The Inception was rushed - it happened too soon without sufficient preparation
	- Solved by rescheduling to give people more time to read all the things
- The format is not correct
	- Solved by reconsidering and rescheduling
- The Facilitator is not properly trained
	- Solved by finding a better one
- Discovery for the Project was not properly executed (ie _nobody_ knows if this is the correct thing to do)
	- Solved by [whoever is in charge of this] returning to square one, Inception rescheduled
- Not enough people on the team are sufficiently informed to be able to conduct an intelligent conversation
	- Solved by rescheduling for 1-2 weeks later, with lots of learning in the meantime
- Key players necessary to the process do not attend for the full duration OR do not participate fully
	- Solved by explaining the benefits, getting feedback on what would make it work for them, accomplishing buy-in
